         I worked at an insurance company for one year, but I`ve always had a keen interest in technology. So, I started looking for opportunities to learn the basics, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js. I also dedicated time to learning TypeScript, which I now use in my projects. I completed some web development courses and began improving my skills by creating projects. I have experience building apps on my own, and I`ve had opportunities to work on projects with a team. I`m currently seeking a full-time junior developer position, with a focus on React.js.
